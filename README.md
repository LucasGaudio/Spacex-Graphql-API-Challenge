# ðŸš€ Front-End challenge - Graphql API SpaceX
This is a quick coding challenge we designed to assess your qualifications as a potential front-end developer. It's important to note that this is by no means a test. We just want to get a sense of how you write code and solve problems.

## The Challenge

- Add prints of your application in the repository and use them in the readme
- Setup instructions
- How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution

- What would you do differently if you were allocated more time
